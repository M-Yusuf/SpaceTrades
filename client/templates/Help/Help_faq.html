<!-- The process is very similar to Facebook, Instagram or Craigslist Buying and Selling. --> 
### How Does It Work?

1. Initial Stage
The Seller creates a new listing and fills out all the necessary information with <a class="link" href='/add'>Add Listing</a> Page. The listing they have completed becomes viewable on the home page.

2. Message Stage 
The Seller awaits messages from interested Buyers. When a Buyer views an item they potentially want to meetup for, they may contact the Seller through <a class="link" href='/chat'>Chat</a>. In the <a class="link" href='/profile/manager'>Manager</a>, both the Seller and Buyer can monitor their own offers and listings. 

3. Offer Stage
The Buyer and Seller decide together on price, date, and location for their future meetup. Once they have decided on these details, the Buyer sends the Seller an Offer accessed from the Offer button on the listing's item page. The offer request has the following options: price, location, date, time, and any trade items if applicable. Once the Seller accepts the meetup request, the meetup has been initiated.

4. Post Meetup Feedback Stage
After the meetup time has passed, both parties will receive a notification with a pending review. From here the feedback system kicks in. Each member of the meetup has the opportunity to evaluate each other on several criteria. This feedback is saved to a user's profile for future reference.

### Do I need to provide a credit card, paypal account...etc?

1. No. SpaceTrades may include online payment systems in the future but currently payment is stricty cash only at the meetup. This is arguably much safer for both parties of a meetup as it denies one member of meetup, the ability to scam the other without any meetup having occured.
