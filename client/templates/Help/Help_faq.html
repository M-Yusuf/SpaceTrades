<!-- The process is very similar to Facebook, Instagram or Craigslist Buying and Selling. --> 
### How Does It Work?

1. Initial Stage


The Seller creates a new listing on the <a class="link" href='/add'>Add Listing</a> page and fills out all the necessary information. This listing becomes viewable on the homepage to the public.

2. Message Stage 


The Seller awaits messages from interested Buyers. When a Buyer views an item they potentially want to meetup for, they may contact the Seller through <a class="link" href='/chat'>Chat</a>. 

At <a class="link" href='/profile/sent'>Sent Offers</a> and <a class="link" href='/profile/sent'>Your Listings</a>, both the Seller and Buyer can monitor their own offers and listings. 

3. Offer Stage


The Buyer and Seller decide together on price, date, and location for their future meetup. Once they have decided on these details, the Buyer sends the Seller an Offer accessed from the Offer button on the listing's item page. The offer request has the following options: price, location, date, time, and any trade items if applicable. Once the Seller accepts the offer request, the meetup has been initiated.

4. Post Meetup Feedback Stage


After the meetup time has passed, both parties will receive a notification with a pending review. From here the feedback system kicks in. Each member of the meetup has the opportunity to evaluate each other. This feedback is saved to a user's profile for future reference.

### Do I need to provide a credit card, paypal account...etc?

1. No. SpaceTrades may include online payment systems in the future but currently payment is strictly cash only at the meetup. This is arguably much safer for both parties of a meetup as it denies one member of meetup, the ability to scam the other without any meetup having occured.

### Can I create an account without Facebook?

1. No. SpaceTrades requires all users to use Facebook in account creation in order to maintain accountability.


### Can I suggest something for the site or just give feedback?

1. Yes of course. <a class="link" href='/help/contact'>Contact Us</a>

### How do I use the message system?. 

1. Buyer, On the listing page of the item you are interested in, click the chat button and message the user in the tab that pops up. 

2. Seller If you are the one who is listing an item Check the Other folder in your Facebook. This can be accesed through the mail button on the top right corner of the navigation bar.

### I had issues during a meetup, what should I do now?

1. Make sure to fill out the Post Meetup Feedback form completely and accurately. We will help from there on.


### How do I relist an item?

1. You can re-list items that you have posted previously in the <a class="link" href="/prof/manager">Manager</a>


### Is there an expiration date for listings?

1. Currently the expiration date is 3 Months
