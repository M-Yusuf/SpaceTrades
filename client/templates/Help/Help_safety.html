## Safety Information

### Don't Reveal Sensitive Personal Information

1. Never reveal information that is unrelated to the meetup that the other party doesn't need to know.


### Only Meet During the Day

1. It's a good idea to meet only in the daytime when more people are outside.

### Always Meet in a Public Place

1. Never agree to meet in a secluded place where there are not any other people present.


### Be Especially Mindful When Trading High Value Items

1. The higher the price of things, the greater the risk of something going wrong.


### Consider Having a Friend Accompany You

1. It's a good idea to have a friend or trusted person accompany you to your meetup.
