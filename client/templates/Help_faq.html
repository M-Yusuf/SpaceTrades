## How does it all work?
The process is very similar to Facebook, Instagram or Craigslist Buying and Selling. 
### 1. Initial Stage
The Seller creates a new listing and fills out all the necessary information on the <a class="link" href='/add'>Add Listing</a> Page. The listing they have completed becomes viewable on the home page.
### 2. Message Stage 
The Seller awaits Facebook messages from interested Buyers. When a Buyer views an item they potentially want to meetup for, they may contact the seller through <a class="link" href='/chat'>Chat</a>. In the <a class="link" href='/profile/manager'>Manager</a>, both the seller and buyer can monitor their own offers and listings. 
### 3. Offer Stage
The Buyer and Seller decide together on <code class="listingitem">price</code> <code class="listingitem">date</code> <code class="listingitem">time</code> and <code class="listingitem">location</code> for their future meetup. Once they have decided on these details, the Buyer sends the Seller an Offer accessed from the Offer button on the listing's item page. The meetup request has the following options: price, location, date, time, and any trade items if applicable. Once the Seller accepts the meetup request, the meetup has been initiated.
### 4. Post Meetup Feedback Stage
After the meetup time has passed, both parties will receive a notification with a pending review. From here the feedback system kicks in. Each member of the meetup has the oppurtunity to review each other. This feedback is saved to users profiles for future reference.

## Do I need to provide a credit card, paypal account...etc?
No. SpaceTrades may include online payment systems in the future but currently payment is stricty cash only at the meetup. This is arguably much safer for both parties of a meetup as it denies one member of meetup, the ability to scam the other without any meetup having occured.

## Can I create an account without Facebook?

No. SpaceTrades requires all users to use Facebook in account creation in order to maintain accountability.

## Can I suggest something for the site or just give feedback?

Yes of course. <a class="link" href='/help/contact'>Contact Us</a>

## How do I use the message system?
SpaceTrades incorporates Facebook for message handling.

### Buyer
On the listing page of the item you are interested in, click the contact button and message the user in the tab that pops up. 
<span class="exampleImage">![Message](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images-spacetrades/example-image-navmessage.png) </span>

### Seller
If you are the one who is listing an item **Check the Other folder in your Facebook**. This can be accesed through the mail button on the top right corner of the navigation bar.
<span class="exampleImage">![Other](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images-spacetrades/example-image-other.png)</span>

## I had issues during a meetup, what should I do now?
Make sure to fill out the Post Meetup Feedback form completely and accurately. We will help from there on.

## How do I relist an item
You can re-list items that you have posted previously in the <a class="link" href="/prof/manager">Manager</a>

## Is there an expiration date for listings
Currently the expiration date is <code class="listingitem">3 Months</code>
